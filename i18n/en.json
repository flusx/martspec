The colors of nature have had their influence on us, and these influences are deep-rooted in our subminds. Colors and their subconscious meaning are there, whether we like it or not. That meaning is independent of race, language, education level, social status, etc.",

            "DESC3_2": "Several sources suggest some color tests work even in cases of defective color-vision or even actual color blindness since the acceptability of a particu­lar color is somatically. In a need of release from tension or stress, then the instinctive response will be to choose the darker colors. If there is a need to dissipate energy then the instinctive response will be for the brighter colors.",
